            <h2>Analysis: Regional Trends in Patent Distribution</h2>
            
            <p>This choropleth visualization reveals significant geographic concentration in US patent activity from 2000-2015, with clear dominance by technology-focused metropolitan areas.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Regional Concentration:</strong> The San Francisco Bay Area (San Jose and San Francisco combined) leads US innovation, accounting for over 233,000 patents during this period. This West Coast dominance extends to Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Diego, collectively representing the nation's primary innovation corridor. The top 10 metropolitan areas account for approximately 45% of all US patents, indicating high geographic concentration of innovative activity.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Temporal Trends:</strong> Patent activity shows strong growth from 2000 to 2015, increasing from approximately 80,000 to 135,000 annual patents—a 68% increase. This growth accelerated notably after 2009, coinciding with economic recovery and increased technology sector investment. The visualization's logarithmic scale reveals that while elite innovation hubs dominate in absolute numbers, mid-tier metropolitan areas (100-1,000 patents annually) demonstrate consistent innovative capacity across diverse US regions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Emerging Patterns:</strong> Traditional manufacturing centers like Detroit maintain patent presence despite industrial shifts, while Sun Belt cities including Austin and Raleigh show accelerating growth trajectories. The East Coast corridor from Boston through New York to Philadelphia remains robust, though growing at slower rates than Western technology hubs.</p>
            
            <p>These patterns suggest that while innovation is democratizing across more US metros, competitive advantages in patent generation remain concentrated in regions with robust technology sectors, research universities, and venture capital access.</p>
